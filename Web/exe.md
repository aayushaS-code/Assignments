Define Internet, Intranet, and Extranet.
  Internet:
-A global network of millions of computers that share information publicly.

Intranet:
-A private network used within an organization, accessible only to members/employees.

Extranet:
-A controlled private network that allows limited access to external users like clients, vendors, or partners



Give one example of each type of network.
-Internet → Websites like Google, YouTube
Intranet → Office internal portal (HR system, company dashboard)
Extranet → Supplier login system, customer order tracking portal



What makes the Intranet more secure than the Internet?
-It is a closed, private network
Access is restricted to authorized users
Uses firewalls, passwords, and internal security policies
No public access



Why is authentication required in an Extranet?
-Because the Extranet allows outsiders (clients/partners) to enter the organization’s network, so authentication ensures:
Only verified users can access
Data protection
Prevents unauthorized access
Maintains security and privacy


Differentiate between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0.
| Feature     | Web 1.0                     | Web 2.0                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Nature      | Static web                  | Dynamic & interactive web               |
| Users       | Only read content           | Read + write content                    |
| Examples    | Early websites, static HTML | Social media, blogs, YouTube            |
| Interaction | Very low                    | High (comments, sharing, collaboration) |





What is an ISP?
-ISP (Internet Service Provider) is a company that provides internet access to users.
Examples: Ncell, WorldLink, Classic Tech.



What is packet switching?
-Packet switching is a method of sending data by breaking it into small packets, sending them independently through the network, and reassembling them at the destination.
Used in: Internet, TCP/IP networks.


How do TCP and IP work together?
- TCP/IP is a two-part protocol:
IP (Internet Protocol) → Routes each packet from source to destination.
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) → Ensures packets arrive safely, in order, and without errors.

Together, they:
Address + route data
Ensure reliable delivery
Reassemble packets at destination


What does DNS do?
-DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses (like 142.250.74.78).
It works like the “phonebook of the internet."
